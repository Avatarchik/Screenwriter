FADE IN:

EXT. STUDIO LOT - NOON

We are introduced to our first location: parking at a studio lot. A small trailer sits in the middle.

CHARACTER ONE
(Overheard)
Whew, the AC in this trailer is pretty powerful.

INT. TRAILER - NOON

Inside of the trailer, CHARACTER ONE sits idle.

CHARACTER ONE
I sure wish I could have some sun! I think I'll go have a walk outside.

EXT. STUDIO LOT - DUSK

Character One leaves the trailer as the sun sets. Frustrated, he shouts:

CHARACTER ONE
(shouting)
Damn it! Just as I was feeling like some Vitamin D!

CHARACTER TWO
Wow! I'm completely unrelated to the story!
