FADE IN:

EXT. LOCATION A - NOON

We are introduced to our first location. It is a small courtyard that looks like the outside of a studio lot. A small trailer sits in the middle.

INT. LOCATION B - NOON

Inside of the trailer, DUMMY 1 sits idle.

DUMMY 1
I sure wish I could have some sun! I think I'll go have a walk outside.

EXT. LOCATION A - DUST

DUMMY 1 leaves the trailer as the sun sets. Frustrated, he shouts:

DUMMY 1
(shouting)
Damn it! Just as I was feeling like some Vitamin D!
